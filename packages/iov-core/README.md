# @iov/core

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@iov/core.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iov/core)

@iov/core is the main entrypoint into the monorepo, exposing high-level functionality
to easily build blockchain clients. It uses the keymanagement functionality of `UserProfile`,
and the generic blockchain connection of `BcpConnection`, and pulls them together into one
`MultiChainSigner`, which can query state and sign transactions on multiple blockchains.
The examples below show a basic usage of the core library. You may also want to experiment
with [@iov/cli](https://github.com/iov-one/iov-core/blob/master/packages/iov-cli/README.md)
as a developer tool to familiarize yourself with this functionality.

## Full Api Docs

Full API Docs from the latest release are hosted at: https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/

If you want to generate documentation for a development branch, please run `yarn docs` in the
current directory and go to [docs/index.html](./docs/index.html).

## Examples

Here are some example use cases. They all build on each other and assume
all imports from above. I also use `await` syntax here, which works inside of async
functions and experimentally in the [@iov/cli](https://github.com/iov-one/iov-core/blob/master/packages/iov-cli/README.md) REPL.
(All imports are done for you in the REPL as well, so you can skip the import
statements. They are provided for guidance when integrating into your own codebase).

Before starting, either run from source in `../iov-cli` via `yarn test-bin`
or install from npm via `npm install -g @iov/cli; iov-cli`.
Inside the cli the remaining code should work verbatim.

### Key Management

Create a random mnemonic:

```ts
import { Bip39, Random } from '@iov/crypto';

// 16 bytes -> 12 word phrase
const entropy16 = await Random.getBytes(16);
const mnemonic12 = Bip39.encode(entropy16).asString();
console.log(mnemonic12);

// 32 bytes -> 24 word phrase
const entropy32 = await Random.getBytes(32);
const mnemonic24 = Bip39.encode(entropy32).asString();
console.log(mnemonic24);
```

Create a new profile with two wallets:

```ts
import { Ed25519HdWallet, UserProfile } from '@iov/keycontrol';

const profile = new UserProfile();
const wallet1 = Ed25519HdWallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic12);
const wallet2 = Ed25519HdWallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic24);
profile.addWallet(wallet1);
profile.addWallet(wallet2);
```

Inspect the profile:

```ts
// look at profile (value reads current state)
console.log(profile.wallets.value);

// listen to the profile (stream of updates, good for reactive UI)
const sub = profile.wallets.updates.subscribe({ next: wallets => console.log(wallets) });
profile.setWalletLabel(wallet1.id, "12 words");
profile.setWalletLabel(wallet2.id, "24 words");
```

Create identies on the two wallets:

```ts
import { HdPaths } from '@iov/keycontrol';
import { Encoding } from '@iov/encoding';
const { fromHex, toHex } = Encoding;

// this creates two different public key identities, generated from the
// first mnemonic using two different SLIP-0010 paths
const id1a = await profile.createIdentity(wallet1.id, HdPaths.simpleAddress(0));
const id1b = await profile.createIdentity(wallet1.id, HdPaths.simpleAddress(1));
console.log(id1a);
console.log(id1a.pubkey.algo, toHex(id1a.pubkey.data))
console.log(id1b.pubkey.algo, toHex(id1b.pubkey.data))

// this creates a different key from the second mnemonic,
// this uses the same HD path as id1a, but different seed.
const id2 = await profile.createIdentity(wallet2.id, HdPaths.simpleAddress(0));
console.log(id2.pubkey.algo, toHex(id2.pubkey.data));

// we can also add labels to the individual identies
profile.setIdentityLabel(wallet1.id, id1a, 'main account');
console.log(profile.getIdentities(wallet1.id));
```

Save and reload keyring:

```ts
const levelup = require('levelup');
// this is for local leveldb in node
const leveldown = require('leveldown');
// use this for indexdb storage in browser
// const browsedown = require('browsedown');

const db = levelup(leveldown('./my_secret_keys'));
// const db = levelup(browsedown('keystore'));


const passphrase = "is seven words enough for the checker?"
await profile.storeIn(db, passphrase);

// this throws an error:
// await UserProfile.loadFrom(db, "garbage");
const loaded = await UserProfile.loadFrom(db, passphrase);

// and we have the same data
console.log(loaded.wallets.value);
const ids = profile.getIdentities(loaded.wallets.value[0].id);
console.log(ids);
console.log(toHex(ids[0].pubkey.data));
console.log(toHex(id1a.pubkey.data));
```

### Interacting with BCP Blockchain

The main use of private keypairs is not just to generate and organize them,
but to actually sign transactions (or encrypt/decrypt messages... not there yet).
To demonstrate this part, we need a working blockchain. If you are ambitious,
you can check out [bcp-demo](https://github.com/iov-one/bcp-demo), and build
the `bov` and `tendermint` binaries, construct your genesis file and run
the client against your one-node "dev net"...

But, if you just want to see how the client works, let's run against iov's testnet
and use the faucet to get some tokens. As of August 6, 2018, the current testnet
is located at https://bov.friendnet-fast.iov.one/ (we are currently roating it in 2-3
week cycles to improve the setup based on loadtests and internal feedback).

To connect, you need to know the address of the rpc server (above).
It is also helpful to know the `chainId` of the chain.
You can find that quite easily by looking
at the [genesis file](https://bov.friendnet-fast.iov.one/genesis) under
`.result.genesis.chain_id`. In our case this is `chain-friendnet-fast`.

### Executing the commands

Discover the address for your identity. This is chain-dependent, so we need
to use the chain-dependent `TxCodec` to generate it. In our case, bnsCodec:

```ts
import { bnsCodec } from '@iov/bns';

const addr = bnsCodec.keyToAddress(id1a.pubkey);
console.log(toHex(addr));
```

If you are running your own "dev-net" give that address plenty of tokens
in the genesis file, by running `bov init IOV $ADDR`.


Now, connect to the network:

```ts
import { bnsConnector, MultiChainSigner } from '@iov/core';

const signer = new MultiChainSigner(profile);
await signer.addChain(bnsConnector('wss://bov.friendnet-fast.iov.one/'));

const chainId = signer.chainIds()[0];
console.log(chainId); // is this what you got yourself?
```

List the tickers on the network:

```ts
const connection = signer.connection(chainId);

const tickers = await connection.getAllTickers();
console.log(tickers.data);
```

Query the testnet for some existing genesis accounts:

```ts
// this is pulled from the genesis account
import { Address } from "@iov/bcp-types"
const bert = "E28AE9A6EB94FC88B73EB7CBD6B87BF93EB9BEF0" as Address;
const faucet = await connection.getAccount({ address: bert });
console.log(faucet);
console.log(faucet.data[0])

// you can also query by registered name
const byName = await connection.getAccount({ name: "bert" });
console.log(byName.data[0])
```

If you are running the testnet faucet, just ask for some free money.

```ts
import { TokenTicker } from "@iov/bcp-types";
import { IovFaucet } from "@iov/faucets";

const faucet = new IovFaucet("https://iov-faucet.yaknet.iov.one");
await faucet.credit(addr, "IOV" as TokenTicker);
```

Then query your account:

```ts
const mine = await connection.getAccount({ address: addr });
console.log(mine); // should show non-empty array for data
console.log(mine.data[0]);

const addr2 = bnsCodec.keyToAddress(id2.pubkey);
console.log(toHex(addr2));
let yours = await connection.getAccount({ address: addr2 });
console.log(yours); // should show empty array for data
```

Send a transaction to second id:

```ts
import { SendTx, TokenTicker, TransactionKind } from "@iov/bcp-types"

const sendTx: SendTx = {
  kind: TransactionKind.Send,
  chainId: chainId,
  signer: id1a.pubkey,  // this account must have money
  recipient: addr2,
  memo: "My first transaction",
  amount: { // 10.11 IOV (9 sig figs in tx codec)
    whole: 10,
    fractional: 110000000,
    tokenTicker: "IOV" as TokenTicker,
  },
};

// the signer has a 0 nonce
console.log(await signer.getNonce(chainId, addr))

// we must have the private key for the signer (id1a)
// second argument is the ID of the wallet where the private key can be found
await signer.signAndPost(sendTx, wallet1.id);

// note that the nonce of the signer is incremented
console.log(await signer.getNonce(chainId, addr))

// and we have a balance on the recipient now
yours = await connection.getAccount({ address: addr2 });
console.log(yours); // should show non-empty array for data
console.log(yours.data[0]); // should show non-empty array for data
```

Now, query the transaction history:

```ts
const history = await connection.searchTx({ tags: [bnsFromOrToTag(addr2)] }));
console.log(history);
const first = history[0].transaction as SendTx;
console.log(first.amount);
// address of recipient
console.log(toHex(first.recipient));
// public key of sender
console.log(toHex(first.signer.data));
// address of sender
const sender = bnsCodec.keyToAddress(first.signer);
console.log(toHex(sender));
```

## Reactive Clients

If you query, the data can get stale, and you may be tempted to start
polling the blockchain. Don't! Instead we offer event streams for
anyone wishing to generate a reactive application. You can simply
log these values, or feed them into a reducer to capture their value.

```ts
// these are helpers for consuming streams
// lastValue will always store the last value,
// asArray will append to an array with list of all tx that were streamed
import { asArray, lastValue } from '@iov/stream';

const liveHeight = lastValue(client.changeBlock());
// if you wait a few seconds, you should see the block-height increase
console.log(liveHeight.value());
console.log(liveHeight.value());
console.log(liveHeight.value());

// you can also watch an account balance
const liveBalance = lastValue(client.watchAccount({address: addr}));
console.log(liveBalance.value());

// or a list of all transactions that touch this account
const liveTx = asArray(client.liveTx({address: addr}));
console.log(liveTx.value());
```

Now, go ahead, send some tokens to this account in another window,
and read the value of the account and tx again, watch them grow.
