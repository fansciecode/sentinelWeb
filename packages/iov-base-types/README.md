@iov/base-types is a set of fundamental types shared between IOV products. The number of
types in here should be as low as possible.

Those types are used in the Tendermint connector as well as the IOV application layer on top of it.
Application specific types go in the package
[@iov/bcp-types](https://github.com/iov-one/iov-core/tree/master/packages/iov-bcp-types).
