# @iov/bns

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@iov/bns.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iov/bns)

This package is an implementation of the BcpConnection interface for the BNS blockchain
(currently just as [bcp-demo](https://github.com/iov-one/bcp-demo) prototype).
It should be able to adapt this code fairly easily to support any other
[weave](https://github.com/confio/weave) based blockchain as well.

This provides a reference implementation of the full feature set of `BcpConnection`, so
it is also a good read when starting support of another blockchain.

Simplest usage, to use auto-detecting tendermint client and standard
bns transaction parser:

```
const client = await Client.connect('wss://bov.wolfnet.iov.one');
```

## API Documentation

[https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-bns/](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-bns/)

The main entry point is the [Client](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-bns/classes/client.html),
which takes a tendermint client (from `iov-tendermint-rpc`) and a codec
to parse transactions. BnsCodec for reading and writing transactions
(also useful for MultiChainSigner) is exported as top-level
[bnsCodec](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-bns/globals.html#bnscodec).
