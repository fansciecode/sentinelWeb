# Protobuf helper

All the serialization codecs are generated protobuf code, with the original definitions remaining
in the [weave repo](https://github.com/iov-one/weave). To update and wrap the codecs, you should
have a basic understanding of the [protobuf format](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3),
as well as the weave repo.

Assuming some basic knowledge, this document will attempt to guide you in updating the codecs.

## Preparing Weave

You will need to have a local copy of weave checked out, and on the proper tag that you want to build.
You can do this by hand or make use of the helper script.

eg. `bash ./scripts/weave.sh v0.9.2`

This will checkout the named tag (eg. v0.9.2) in a subdirectory called weave.

## Compiling the protobuf

One you have checked out weave, there are a few steps to compile the protobuf.
We wrap them all in a helper script, but here they are for your understanding...

`yarn find-proto`: will produce a list of all proto files we care about in the weave directory you
checked out before. We ignore the examples, but do want to compile all available ./cmd directories,
which we support. (or just bnsd?)

There is currently an issue here, as package name is used to differentiate the objects in the compiled
javascript. And `./app`, `./cmd/bnsd/app` and `./cmd/bcpd/app` all define protobuf with the `package app`
definition. These can be combined, but as bcpd and bnsd define the same type (`Tx`), this is a conflict.

**TODO**: update weave to provide unique package names, not just different paths. At this point, we can
compile `./cmd/bnsd` and `./cmd/bcpd` together. We will have to update package names in calling code.

`yarn pack-proto`: will compile all the protobuf files returned by `yarn find-proto` into a javascript module
located at `./src/generated/codecimpl.js`. This contains the codecs to serialize and deserialize everything.

`yarn define-proto`: will generate typescript definitions for `./src/generated/codecimpl.js` and
save them under `src/generated/codecimpl.d.ts`. This allows us to properly use all the codecs from typescript.

## Quick setup

To pull this all together, you can just use the helper function `protoc`... This will perform the entire normal
usecase of updating weave, compiling the named `*.proto` files, generating type definitions, and formating them nicely.
Just pass the VERSION you want to compile as an environmental variable, and call:

`VERSION=v0.9.2 yarn protoc`
